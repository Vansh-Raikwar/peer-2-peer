# P2P File Sharing Application

A peer-to-peer file sharing application built with React, TypeScript, WebRTC, and WebSocket. Share files directly between browsers with encrypted, serverless transfers.

## Features

- **Direct P2P Transfer** - Files stream straight between browsers over a WebRTC DataChannel
- **Bidirectional Transfers** - Either peer can send files after the connection is established
- **Encrypted by Default** - WebRTC secures every transfer in transit with DTLS encryption
- **No Server Storage** - The signaling server only handles discovery and connection setup
- **Relay Fallback** - If direct P2P is unavailable, messages can be relayed through the server to keep the session working
- **Large File Support** - Chunked transfer with backpressure handling keeps big files reliable
- **Connection Control** - Accept or decline connection requests before a transfer starts
- **Real-time Progress** - Live upload and download progress tracking for sender and receiver
- **Multi-user Support** - See all online users and connect with any of them

- **Custom Names & Device Info** - Register custom display names and device details (model, manufacturer) for easy identification
- **Advanced Controls** - Request a peer to send a file or seamlessly cancel connection requests
- **Dual Relay Fallback** - Ensures connectivity when direct P2P fails through two layers: first utilizing a standard WebRTC TURN server, and if that fails, falling back to an application-level relay that securely routes file chunks through the WebSocket server to keep the session working.

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite (Build tool)
- TailwindCSS (Styling)
- WebRTC (P2P connections)
- WebSocket (Signaling)

**Backend:**

- Node.js + Express
- ws (WebSocket library)
- TypeScript

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Modern browser with WebRTC support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd p2psharing
```

### 2. Setup Server

```bash
cd server
npm install

# Create .env file from example
copy .env.example .env

# Edit .env and set your port
PORT=3001

# Start the server
npm run build
npm start
```

The WebSocket server will start and listen for connections on port 3001. Note that this is a WebSocket server, not an HTTP server, so you won't be able to access it via a browser at `http://localhost:3001`.

### 3. Setup Client

```bash
cd client
npm install

# Create .env file from example
copy .env.example .env

# Edit .env and set your WebSocket URL
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Client will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Test P2P Transfer

1. Open two browser tabs (or different browsers)
2. Both tabs will connect to the signaling server
3. You'll see each other in the "Online Users" list
4. Click on a user to send a connection request
5. Accept the request in the other tab
6. Once connected, select a file and transfer

## How It Works

### Connection Flow

Connection requests are forwarded directly to the recipient. To ensure reliability, if a direct WebRTC connection fails to establish within 10 seconds or drops later, the application falls back to a cloud relay mode, converting file chunks to base64 and routing them through the signaling server.

```
1. User A connects to WebSocket server (can register name/device)
   ↓
2. User B connects to WebSocket server
   ↓
3. Server broadcasts online users list (with device info)
   ↓
4. User A clicks on User B (request is forwarded directly)
   ↓
5. User B accepts the request via modal (or rejects it)
   ↓
6. Server sends webrtc-start signal to both users
   ↓
7. WebRTC handshake begins
   ├── User A creates offer
   ├── User B creates answer
   └── ICE candidates exchanged
   ↓
8. DataChannel opens (P2P connection established)
   ↓
9. File transfer happens directly between peers
   └── If needed, relay fallback keeps messages moving through the server
```

### File Transfer Protocol:

### Sending Process

```
1. Sender selects file
   ↓
2. Validate DataChannel is open
   ↓
3. Send META message with file info (name, size, type)
   ↓
4. Read file in 64KB chunks using FileReader
   ↓
5. Send each chunk as ArrayBuffer via DataChannel
   ↓
6. Monitor bufferedAmount for backpressure
   ├── If buffer > 1MB threshold, pause sending
   └── Resume when onbufferedamountlow fires
   ↓
7. Report progress via onSendProgress callback
   ↓
8. Send DONE message when all chunks sent
```

### Receiving Process

```
1. Receive META message
   ├── Store file metadata (name, size, type)
   └── Initialize empty buffer array
   ↓
2. Receive binary chunks
   ├── Convert ArrayBuffer to Uint8Array
   ├── Push to receivedBuffers array
   ├── Track receivedSize
   └── Report progress via onReceiveProgress callback
   ↓
3. Receive DONE message
   ├── Create Blob from all chunks
   ├── Create File object with original filename
   └── Trigger onFileReceived callback
   ↓
4. UI creates download URL via URL.createObjectURL()
   ↓
5. User clicks download button to save file
```

## Usage

### Basic File Transfer

1. **Connect**: Users appear in the sidebar when online
2. **Request**: Click on a user's name to send connection request
3. **Accept**: Other user accepts the request via modal
4. **Transfer**: Use "Choose File" button to select and send files
5. **Download**: Receiver gets download button when transfer completes

### Multiple Transfers

- Currently supports one active connection per user
- Disconnect current peer to connect with another user
- Multiple transfers can happen sequentially
- After a transfer completes, you can send or receive another file without refreshing the page
- Transfer direction is not fixed: both peers can send files to each other after the connection is live
- You can even click the **Download** icon during a connection to prompt your peer to select a file and send it to you

## Environment Variables

### Server (.env)

```env
PORT=3001                    # WebSocket server port
```

### Client (.env)

```env
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001    # WebSocket server URL
```

**Note**: In production, use `wss://` (secure WebSocket) instead of `ws://`
